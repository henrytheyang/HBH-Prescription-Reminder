Design notes:
  Going with a lot of id in css, not class- not ideal, but so few objects that
    the code will be more readable than using a bunch of classes
  Not using Redux for state management- mostly because the state-dependant block
    is only 2 levels deep for me to spend the time to set up Redux


Design suggestions:
  Make the logo a favicon
  Instead of large logo to right, a large transparent/faded background logo?

  Links on bottom- contact, my account, link to FDA page of drug?
  Links to two commonly co-purchased drugs, with next/prev buttons for a carousel

  Consider requiring patient to be signed in, then auto-load name, email, Rx

Mobile-first concerns-
  Larger buttons
  Expandable content
  NO hover
