Design notes:
  Not using Redux for state management- mostly because the state-dependant block
    is only 2 levels deep, too shallow to spend the time to set up Redux
  Would usually work on development branches, then do pull requests into main branch
  Would usually write tests before the design but this layout is boilerplate
  Hid text blocks until after submit was clicked- cleaner look.

Design suggestions:
  Make the logo a favicon
  Press enter in any field to trigger submit

  Move submit button above text blocks
  Instead of large logo to right, a large transparent/faded background logo?
  Links on bottom- honeybee contact, my account, link to FDA page of drug?
  Links to two commonly co-purchased drugs, with next/prev buttons for a carousel

  Consider requiring patient to be signed in, then auto-load name, email, Rx

Mobile-first concerns-
  Larger buttons
  Expandable content
  NO hover
  Width considerations
